"1.3.2":"Fixed the Sprout mobs spawning insane amounts.  Golems will no longer shoot through walls, their projectiles now have block collision.  Guardian of Sprites will no longer bump and push players around in creative.  Guardian of Sprites will now despawn in peaceful mode.  Fixed owls spamming eggs; they now have laying rates increased to between 500 and 900 seconds randomly (still only on leaves).  "
