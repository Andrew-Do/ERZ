"1.3.2":"Fixed the Sprout mobs spawning insane amounts.  Golems will no longer shoot through walls, their projectiles now have block collision.  Guardian of Sprites will no longer bump and push players around in creative.  Guardian of Sprites will now despawn in peaceful mode.  Fixed owls spamming eggs; they now have laying rates increased to between 500 and 900 seconds randomly (still only on leaves).   Lingering potions spawned from certain rainbow slimes no longer last forever, also they make the potion splash sound when starting.  Fixed Timber Wolves duplicating on world reload.  Fixed Timber Wolves spawning way too much.  Fixed timber wolves dealing zero damage.  Temporarily disabled the taming and breeding of Timber Wolves since it was buggy (will revisit in later update.)

 Many more config flags added to control mob behavior.   "
 
 
 "1.3.3":"Fixed the green flying Sprites so that they do despawn as normal (previously they would NEVER despawn, making it look like they were multiplying or spawning in mass numbers).  Sprites now only spawn in darkness, instead of ignoring light levels.  
 Fixed some flying mobs and the camo Slimes not working with the spawn rate configs.  Reduced attack frequency of Dire Wolf.  
 Fixed issues with the mod using biomeWhitelist configs not affecting some mobs.   Changed several default config values changed for balance reasons; does not change existing config files (Attack damage and health reduced for several mobs; some default spawn rates reduced).  Changed timberwolf egg color slightly so it stands out more.  Added spawn eggs to a creative tab.  Fixed Mini enderman not loading its loot table.    Bigger sprites are now a different color to help tell the difference from smaller ones.  Fixed Sprites using hardcoded 3.0 damage instead of reading from config.  Sprites will no longer attack creative mode players and cause them knockback.  
Guardian of Sprites should no longer forget to drop Totem of Undying.  "
