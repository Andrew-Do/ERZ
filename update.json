"1.3.2":"Fixed the Sprout mobs spawning insane amounts.  Golems will no longer shoot through walls, their projectiles now have block collision.  Guardian of Sprites will no longer bump and push players around in creative.  Guardian of Sprites will now despawn in peaceful mode.  Fixed owls spamming eggs; they now have laying rates increased to between 500 and 900 seconds randomly (still only on leaves).   Lingering potions spawned from certain rainbow slimes no longer last forever, also they make the potion splash sound when starting.  Fixed Timber Wolves duplicating on world reload.  Fixed Timber Wolves spawning way too much.  Fixed timber wolves dealing zero damage.  Temporarily disabled the taming and breeding of Timber Wolves since it was buggy (will revisit in later update.)

 Many more config flags added to control mob behavior.   "
